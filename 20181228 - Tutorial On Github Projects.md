##### 4.1 Introduction

Many projects manage tasks using tools such as JIRA and Redmine as project management tools. In this tutorial I would like to describe how to use [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/categories/managing-your-work-on-github/) which can manage tasks relatively easily on Github.

GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs.

##### 4.2 Task management
- 4.2.1 Create a project board

In the Github Project, you can customize the project board (Kanban tool) freely.

You can create a project board by pressing the "Create Project" button and entering the name of the project.

- 4.2.2 Create columns

When creating a project board, a blank dashboard with nothing at first appears as shown below.

You are going to add a column here about what you manage as a task for each project here. Your Github project will manage tasks with the following four statuses.
